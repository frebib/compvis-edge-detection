1) Work out difference in effectiveness between gaussian 3x3 and 5x5 using the following:
  - simple (gradient)
  - sobel
  - roberts
  - prewitt
  - laplacian
  - first-order-gaussian (from lab 3)
  - canny

    a) Also maybe try several pass gauss

2) Work out the best threshold value between all filters with the mosteffective gaussian blur from (1), including LoG

3) Plot graphs of several thresholds of the best filter from (2)
